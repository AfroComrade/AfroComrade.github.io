<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>Data collection has been pervasive in recent years. Private enterprise uses personal data for targeted content, to the extent that they trade and buy personal data. Despite this, the information gained from mass data collection is invaluable. This article is going to explore the value and opportunities granted by that information, particularly in the public domain. While the private sector uses personal data for profit, there are public and educational uses of data that improve our lives and our society.</p>

<p>The first point to bring up is statistical analysis. In NZ, we have public access to statistics and insights through websites like StatsNZ, EducationCounts and IRD. Often, before we begin any venture, we need information. The statistics provided by these websites grant us that informed information and trends about our society and country so we know how to move forward. From these statistics, we are also more informed about issues and concerns beyond our personal bubble. For example, New Zealand’s education system places a big emphasis on Maori and Pacific educational participation & achievement. We can see from EducationCounts that, relative to the general population, Maori & Pacific education is lacking. This is an example of well intended statistics based on data collection.</p>

<p>The next point to bring up is opt-in data collection. While we have The General Data Protection Regulation from the EU to monitor and allow deletion of data, generally speaking we’re unaware of what data businesses are collecting from us. Exceptions to this are surveys, census and opt-in data collection. These are the bread and butter of public data collection, so that informed decisions can be made about the populace. It’s through these we can see the trends and patterns from the websites above, but also how important information like medical history can be rapidly moved in times of emergency. NZ’s COVID tracing app of 2020 is a perfect example of this. In a vigilant world where a pandemic can occur at any time, the ability to trace and track people that travel to different businesses is invaluable. NZ is fortunate enough to have a population that participates in the COVID tracking. With the data collected voluntarily from us, we can rapidly quell outbreaks as they come up. This kind of data collection is invaluable, and has left NZ as having one of the best COVID responses in the world.</p>
