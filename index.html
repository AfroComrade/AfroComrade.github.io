<h1 style="color: #008B8B">Opportunities afforded by Data Collection in modern society</h1>

<p>Data collection has been pervasive in recent years. Private enterprise uses personal data for targeted content, to the extent that they trade and buy personal data. Despite this, the information gained from mass data collection is invaluable. This article is going to explore the value and opportunities granted by that information, particularly in the public domain. While the private sector uses personal data for profit, there are public and educational uses of data that include public statistics, opt-in data collection, and statistical analysis that can change modern society for the better. </p>

<p>The first point to bring up is statistical analysis. In NZ, we have public access to statistics and insights through websites like StatsNZ, EducationCounts and IRD. Often, before we begin any venture, we need information. The statistics provided by these websites grant us that informed information and trends about our society and country so we know how to move forward. From these statistics, we are also more informed about issues and concerns beyond our personal bubble. For example, New Zealand is overrepresented in youth suicide rates, particularly for Maori peoples. 

<br>


<img src="images/SuicideRates.png" alt="Table chart of NZ Suicide Rates">
<ul><li><i>Fig 1. 2020 Annual provisional suicide statistics.</li>

<li>"The highest rate (of suicide), of  15.6 per 100,000 – nine times higher than in Portugal – is to be found in New Zealand" - Unicef (2017)</li></i></ul>
<br>
New Zealand also has underrepresentation for Maori people in educational attainment. The connections between these two are beyond the scope of this article, however this information gives us an insight into the challenges faced by marginalized groups in New Zealand. We can see evidence of attempts to change that, with programmes and scholarships intended to target these groups, and improve quality of life. These are the sorts of statistics we can use for informed decision making.</p>

<p>The next point to bring up is opt-in data collection. While we have the General Data Protection Regulation from the EU to monitor and allow deletion of data, generally speaking we’re unaware of what data businesses are collecting from us. Exceptions to this are surveys, census and opt-in data collection. These are the bread and butter of public data collection, so that informed decisions can be made about the populace. An example of this is New Zealand's referendum on abortion and marijuana. Through collating people's political preferences, we can make change to move New Zealand forward. </p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/NZReferendum.png" alt="Abortion Referendum Results">
<ul><li><i>Fig 2. Official results of the end of life choice referendum </li></i></ul>
<br>
<p>This wouldn't be possible without the data collected from surveys and census. While NZ's government had a decent idea about the direction this referendum would take, the information gleamed from this means they can make a more informed decision about policy going forward. Another great example of opt-in data collection is New Zealand's COVID tracing app of 2020. In a vigilant world where an epidemic can strike at any time, the ability to trace and track people that travel to different businesses is invaluable. NZ is fortunate enough to have both the population and the infrastructure to participate in the COVID tracking. Making covid tracing mandatory for businesses was a big step in keeping on top of this. With the data collected voluntarily from us, we can rapidly quell outbreaks as they come up. This kind of data collection is invaluable, and has left NZ as having one of the best COVID responses in the world.<br></p>

<p>A third point to bring up is academic analysis. Raw statistics are valuable for information, but educated understanding of that information is what leads to understandable and digestable knowledge. And that can lead to change. A good example can be read in a study done in 2012 about the five personality traits, and how they most determine academic achievement. It includes internal and external motivations, but one of the biggest predictors of academic achievement is conscientiousness.</p>

<br>
<img src="images/PersonalityPredictor.png" alt="Personality Predictor Table">
<ul><li><i>Fig 3. The effect of personality traits on academic performance: The mediating role of academic motivation (2012) </li></i></ul>


<p>We can can see here, and in many other studies, the value of correlating and interpreting data. Through this, we can identify that becoming more conscientious can lead to higher grades. And we can know this, because of data collected by surveys and studies and then analyzed. Another good example is the study for optimism versus conscientiousness in the predictor for academic achievement.</p>

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ConscientiousnessVsOptimism.png" alt="Conscientiousness Vs Optimism Chart">
<ul><li><i>Fig 4. Interaction effect of dispositional optimism and conscientiousness on students’ academic performance. (2019) </li></i></ul>
<br>

<p>Understanding and interpreting information is its own subset of skills and beyond the scope of this article. However, we can see and recognize the value in learning these correlations. Learning that conscientiousness is a valuable trait in academia means we learn to become conscientious ourselves, and make change necessary to learn and grow. Learning that optimism is an inverse predictor of performance in low-conscientious people means that those people who know they are less mindful can be sure to shore up their shortcomings. This information is invaluable for personal growth and achievement in academia. We can use this to alter our own behaviour or recognize behaviour in other people and help our individual communities grow.</p>

<p> A final small point I want to bring up is medical data collection. COVID and suicide rates have already been mentioned, but a big key in improving life expectancy and quality of life is medical data collection. Water fluoridation is the example I want to mention here. NZ's Ministry of Health (2021) state that there is 40% less tooth decay afflicting young children and teenagers in areas with fluoridated water. We would not know that statistic, or the epidemic of tooth decay in New Zealand, were it not for data collection and aggregation of tooth decay. </p>

<p>To finish this off, there is plenty of value in data collection in modern society. We can see the results of data collection to recognize over- or under-representation and make changes to improve them. We can use opt-in data collection to make policies and improve response time on national emergencies. We can also analyze and interpret data to make better and more informed decisions about ourselves and the populace. While data collection is definitely pervasive in the corporate world, the effects of social data collection cannot be understated. Knowing where the holes or the neglect are in ourselves and our communities means we gain the perspective to move forward knowingly in the world. And knowing where we excel or our communities thrive means we can learn and leap ahead those categories, or use them to prop up neglected groups until they are healed.</p> 			</div>

			                <h1 style="color: #008B8B">What are the risks of Data Collection?</h1>
			<h3 style="color: #00cccc"> Privacy concerns </h3>
               


<p> With the use of data collection, an issue to consider is concerns of privacy. This is the idea of what data related to us is collected, how is it collected, who is collecting it, and why? It is commonly understood that a company will store some type of data from us when we use their websites, for example if you want to use LinkedIn, you will need to make your own personal account. This account will require at least an email account, username and password. These three datatypes are the most collected and stored data in the whole of the internet. If you want to be able to sign into an account, the server the website is running off needs to be able to access this data to authorize your log in. Going back to the example of LinkedIn you will find that you are also sharing even more personal information.
 To complete your profile, they will now have your full name, date of birth, phone number, location, gender, prior and current education, your employer and employment history. But it does not end here, when you begin to use the platform, all your photos, videos and personal messages you have on LinkedIn must be saved, so that you can access your account from anywhere around the world on any device. The use of these types of data are mostly understood, a user must be willing to give up some form of anonymity when creating an account for a website, especially social media platforms.</p>

 <p>However, the collection of this data’s primary purpose is not keeping the services running smoothly so that you can access your personal profile from any device, on any network. The main business model for most online sites is advertising, and our data is worth an enormous sum of money, the more personalized this information is, the more it is worth. From the personal information you have given to the website, to your browsing history, liked pages, interests and networks within the sites. 
 A gross offender of this model is Facebook. 98% of Facebooks $55 billion USD profit in 2018, was generated from advertising. Facebook would collect, and analyze user-generated data from Facebook.com, other Facebook owned services, and third-party websites that use Facebook Business Tools (social plugins, like and share buttons etc.)</p>
 <h3 style="color: #00cccc"> Data Breaches</h3>

 <p>Considering how much our personal information is worth, the biggest privacy concerns are data breaches. The best source for online data breaches is haveibeenpwned.com. It is an open-source website, dedicated to tracking and analyzing data from all breaches that occur on a nearly weekly basis. They are collaborating with the FBI, as said by the FBI’s Assistant Director of the Cyber Division, Bryan A. Vorndran “We are excited to be partnering with HIBP on this important project to protect victims of online credential theft. It is another example of how important public/private partnerships are in the fight against cybercrime." </p>
 <p>According to HIBP, there are over 11 billion accounts that have been compromised from 540 websites. Going back to the example of LinkedIn, in 2012 their database was hacked, compromising 164 million email addresses and passwords. This data was being offered for sale on a dark market website in 2016. Or if we continue talking about Facebook, in April of 2021, a data set of 500 million users each containing a phone number that could be linked to identities was released publicly. </p>

  <h3 style="color: #00cccc"> Social Media Radicalization</h3>
 <p>A newfound and not entirely understood issue with data collection, is the polarization of politics on social media. How is data collection related to this issue? Search engine and recommendation algorithms. Using the personal data a website knows about you (such as age, location, gender, ethnicity, search history, interests), these algorithms will search through entire datasets, to recommend to you content and advertisements that cater to you. The issue arises when these systems can help reinforce ideas people have, by showing them content that fits within their world view. This is known as an echo chamber, where people become surrounded by others who have the same beliefs. 
 This can cause each end of the political spectrum to radicalize as they become further and further detached from the middle. This process can happen rapidly, if you are using websites and search engines who have third-party cookies that link to each other, every website you jump on will continue to display similar narratives to you. </p>

<h1 style="color: #008B8B">The Past and the Future Choices of Data Collection</h1>
			   <h5 style="color:#F0F8FF">Data is part of the fabric of life and society — and has been for a long time. The history of data is a long story detailing the evolution of data collection, storage and processing.
It’s said that knowledge is power. Well, data is knowledge, and we’re now seeing the power that our data holds.<br>
We also don't know what the future of data collection would be like and whether it will change our lives or if it will have a great impact on our society.</h5>

			<h3 style="color: #00cccc"> The evolution Of Data collection</h3>
 <p>The earliest examples we have of humans storing and analyzing data are the tally sticks. The Ishango Bone was discovered in 1960 in what is now Uganda and is thought to be one of the earliest pieces of evidence of prehistoric data storage. Palaeolithic tribespeople would mark notches into sticks or bones, to keep track of trading activity or supplies. They would compare sticks and notches to carry out rudimentary calculations, enabling them to make predictions such as how long their food supplies would last.</p>

<h5 style="color: snow">The late 1800s: data processing problems</h5><p>The next big event in the history of data occurred following the 1880 US census. Over the decades, the census had grown, asking more and more questions about the populace. The issue was that there was now more data than collectors could analyse.
<strong style="color: #FDF5E6;">Herman Hollerith </strong>was the man to solve the problem, with his brainchild: the Hollerith desk. This machine harnessed the power of punch cards — an invention from Joseph Jacquard in 1801. With the collected data represented as holes in cards, the machine could find the holes, which would complete a circuit. A completed circuit would move a dial up by one. This reduced the time taken to complete the 1890 census. Hollerith’s machine made it possible to process and analyse large amounts of data. And, sure enough, punch card automation became a widespread way to collect and analyse data.</p>
    <img src="images/future1.png" alt="Table chart of NZ Suicide Rates">
	<img src="images/future2.png" alt="Table chart of NZ Suicide Rates">

	<h5 style="color: snow">1990s: The internet</h5><p> One of the most important-notewrothy 1990s event in the history of data is the invention of the internet. Sir Tim Berners Lee created hyperlinks and hypertext, enabling data sharing worldwide.
It wasn’t long until the first instance of all web-based storage, launched by AT&T in the mid-1990s.
Other notable moments for the history of data in the 90s include 1997, which saw the launch of Google Search. This put data very much in the hands of anyone with computer access. This also helped people store their data.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #00cccc"> The Future Of Data collection</h3>
<h5 style="color: snow">5G Cellular Networks</h5><p> Cellular companies are on the verge of finalizing 5G networking, one of the most revolutionary advancements in internet related technology. Advancing to 5G networking will mean incredible downloading speed and elimination of latency issues. The amount of data that will be generated by 5g networks will be too massive for humans to manage and analyze, so that would probably be handled by AI. By AI taking over data collection it’ll be able to predict future problems and take preemptive actions to avoid them.
</p>			

<h5 style="color: snow">Human Impanted Computers</h5><p> You might have heard Elon Musk ranting about human implanted computers, that one day humans will have computers implanted in their heads capable of merging their brains with AI. But the one problem of these human implanted computers would be privacy. By merging AI or implanting computers in your head they will be able to monitor every move you make, it’s like someone watching over you all the time.

		<h5 style="color:#F0F8FF">Yeran Edmonds (20103362)</h5>
		
		<p>Using ACM's code of ethics as a guideline, I would say that based on our research, private enterprise does NOT abide by the code of ethics. Much of private use of data is not honest, not trustworthy, and does not respect privacy or confidentiality. It takes considerable research about a company to know how much data they collect about you and how they use it, which is not easily accessible. Additionally, private use of data appears to primarily for monetary gain.</p>
		<p>Using ACM's code of ethics as a guideline, I would say that many aspects of the public sector abides by the code of ethics, to a degree. The data is generally honored, privacy is kept, and it is often used for good. However we do not know what is gathered from us besides the most known and public uses of it, such as the COVID app or referendums. I also cannot speak to the surveillance sector, which inherently would not want to share what data it collects. I have no evidence as to believe if the surveillance sector uses the data honorably and respecting of privacy</p>
		<p>The sentiments shared above by ACM's code of ethics is shared by myself. I believe public use of data is currently good, but I also do not know enough about how it is used. A lot more data is public than I thought, but I suspect there is more data not being shown to the public. I also cannot speak to how well it is used. I Believe private use of data, particularly from big companies, is definitely flawed and needs improving. Policies like GDPR and Apple's recent data privacy update have gone a long way towards protecting that</p>
		
		
		<h5 style="color:#F0F8FF">Emmanuel Francis (20123197)</h5>
		
		<p>When collecting data, ethical issues include ensuring that the children or people involved are not harmed in any manner. The inquiries and observations must be conducted in a polite manner, with their dignity taking precedence. At all times, people's right to privacy must be protected. There must be an acceptable level of confidentially of the research data when it is being analyzed.</p>

		<p>The ethical issues I have towards data collection entirely relates to privacy and confidentiality. In particular, the invasiveness of big tech companies when they collect, and analyze user-generated data, across their own platforms as well as third-party cookies. Not just from a monetary standpoint through advertising. But what incredible influence having so much information on billions of people has. I believe people should be able to access the internet freely, without having it collected by someone else to be used to sell advertisements or recommend more content. </p>
		<p>Businesses continue to use this model, even though this goes against public good. A recent example that shows people trending towards not wanting to be tracked is with Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, upon signing in people are given the choice to opt in or out of apps tracking their data. An astounding 96% of its users chose to opt out of it. With such an alarming amount of people waking up to this idea, businesses who follow this model are going to have to adjust to the social revolution of data security. From this has come a wave of new businesses offering VPN services. Giving people back some form of anonymity when browsing the internet. </p>
